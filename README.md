# 📖 Recipe Page – Frontend Mentor Challenge

Frontend Mentor challenges help improve coding skills by building realistic front-end projects.  
This project is a static recipe page built with **HTML5** and **Tailwind CSS (via CDN)**, following a mobile-first, responsive design approach.

## 🛠️ Built With

- Semantic HTML5  
- Tailwind CSS (via CDN)  
- Mobile-first responsive layout

## 💡 What I Learned

While building this recipe page, I practiced:

- Creating a responsive layout using only HTML and Tailwind CSS  
- Using flex, grid, spacing, (and typography utilities) from Tailwind  
- Applying mobile-first design principles with Tailwind breakpoints  
- Writing clean and semantic HTML (for accessibility and SEO)  
- Structuring a small project clearly with a simple build process  

---

## 🚀 Continued Development

In future projects, I plan to:

- Set up Tailwind with PostCSS and a local build process  
- Use more components and reusable Tailwind utilities  
- Explore accessibility best practices in more depth
